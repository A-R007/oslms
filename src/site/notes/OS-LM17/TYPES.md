- **Server Virtualization:**
    
    - Divides server resources into multiple virtual servers.
    - Uses hypervisors to create a layer between physical server components and the software.
    - Types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted).
    
- **Storage Virtualization:**
    
    - Combines multiple physical storage devices into a single virtual storage unit.
    - Provides flexible and efficient storage management without additional physical storage investments.
    
- **Network Virtualization:**
    
    - Integrates various network resources into a single virtual network managed by software.
    - Enhances network flexibility and efficiency at lower costs.
    
- **Application Virtualization:**
    
    - Allows applications to be run on a server and accessed over a network without local installation.
    - Facilitates access to a wide range of applications in real-time without significant storage requirements.
    - Simplifies IT management by reducing the need for local updates and installations.
    
- **Desktop Virtualization:**
    
    - Provides virtual desktop environments accessible from any device.
    - Centralizes management and distribution of updates, reducing security risks associated with local data storage.
    - Ensures data integrity and availability even if individual devices fail.
    
- **Data Virtualization:**
    
    - Integrates data from multiple sources into a single virtual data view.
    - Facilitates centralized data management and analysis without duplicating data.
    - Utilizes a virtualization layer to separate data sources from the front-end application.
